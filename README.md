# worldcore

This is a 2010 snapshot of a unfinished reboot of https://github.com/drollings/Phase3MUD.  More flexible STL data structures, more support for scripting with API standards managed by Thrift, and a common core of code which simultaneously supported file parsing, user permissions, and run-time modifications to the game environment were accounted for.

Emerging changes in C++ standards made a deeper overhaul more compelling.
